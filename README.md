CV Website - María García Sánchez

In this file from Github, I wouled like to share how to do subject to create this cool summary as website.
I used HTML, CSS, JavaSript, and my Knowledge of Ux/UI Design,which is one of the most important parts to facilitate navigation to customers. 
Also, consider this proffesional project as the first of my portfolio and it is responsive which mean that works on multiple devices.
I Hope you like it.
